## Overview

This is a Python-based machine learning-trained image scanning notebook and algorithm for predicting the presence and severity of Alzheimer's disease. As of right now it is a purely back-end project and must be run as a notebook or otherwise in a coding environment, but it is viable.

## Development

This is a portfolio project that I created in June and July of 2025 with the idea of eventually creating a publicly accessible medical diagnostic tool.

## Instructions for Use
* Please download the following files to the same directory: Alzheimers_MRI_Detector_Final_Version.ipynb, Alzheimers_Test_Dataset.parquet, Alzheimers_Train_Dataset.parquet, and best_dualpool201_model.keras.
* Please download any sample png images if you wish into the same directory.
* Please run the Alzheimers_MRI_Detector_Final_Version.ipynb notebook in a proper coding environment. Please be advised that it may take quite some time if you're doing it locally without a powerful rig. It should automatically compile and train itself based on the CNN keras file.
* Adjust parameters in the image predictor code blocks as desired. There is also a toggle to stop the Run All just before the loading and training blocks if you wish to use it.
* If you have an overhead MRI scan you wish to evaluate, please keep it in the directory and have it named accordingly, as test##.jpg with the '##' part replaced by a number from 01 to 20.
* JPEG images are vastly more accurates since that was the file type from the Parquet dataset.
* Images larger than 128 x 128 will be resized. Images smaller than that will be rejected
